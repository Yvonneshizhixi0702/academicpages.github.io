Hi, my name is Shi Zhixi (石芷溪) and you can also call me Yvonne. I am now working as a full-time Research Assistant in the department of Accountancy at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) and I will graduate with a Master's degree in Statistics from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in January 2024.I am eager to express my strong interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in Accounting, particularly focusing on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Corporate Disclosures. My passion for these areas has been nurtured through a series of academic and professional experiences, which have shaped my academic aspirations and research goals.

You can find my CV here: [Zhixi's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
