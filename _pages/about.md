Hi, my name is Shi Zhixi (石芷溪) and you can also call me Yvonne. Currently, I serve as a full-time Research Assistant in the Accountancy department at City University of Hong Kong (CityU). I recently completed my Master's degree in Statistics at the National University of Singapore (NUS) earlier this year. This September, I will commence my PhD journey in Accounting at INSEAD (Asia Campus). My research interests primarily revolve around Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues and Corporate Disclosures.

You can find my CV here: [Zhixi's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
